## Why Another Ethiopian Music Player Bruh?
Well, _all_ Ethiopian music platforms I've seen don't come close to the _industry standard_ of a music player, are riddled with ads and **unbearable** UI/UX

## Stack
Zefenify front-end is built with Howler, React, React-Router, Redux, Redux-Saga, Emotion and lots of 🍺

## Browser Support
Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Edge are supported

## TODO
